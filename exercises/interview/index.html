<h1> An Interview with Erin Hayes</h1>

  <div class="question-container-1">
      <div><span class="zoe-1">Zoe</span> What is your favorite nickname that you’ve been given?</div>
      <div><span class="erin-1">Erin</span> I have a complicated relationship with nicknames, actually. The only one that has stuck is Hayes, my last name, but even then it hasn’t really felt like MY nickname. My favorite though would probably be Hazelnut, but it is longer than my actual name, so I’m not sure it really counts haha </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-container-2">
      <div><span class="zoe-2">Zoe</span></div>
        <div> What's the best piece of advice you've ever been given?</div>
      <div><span class="erin-2">Erin</span></div>
        <div>Think about your knowledge like a bubble. Increase the surface area of that bubble by exploring in one direction until you get bored and want to go somewhere else. Then follow your interests to another corner and expand your knowledge there for a while. Continue this process your whole life, always expanding the surface area of your bubble. Never settle into the comfort of doing what you already know. 
  </div>

  <div class="question-container-3">
      <div><span class="zoe-3">Zoe</span> What is your favorite color?</div>
      <div><span class="erin-3">Erin</span> Pink :) </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-container-4">
      <div><span class="zoe-4">Zoe</span></div>

      <div class="answer-4">
        <div><span class="erin-4">Erin</span></div>
        <div>I can break apples in half with my hands.</div>
      </div>
  </div>

 <div class="question-container-5a">
      <div><span class="zoe-5">Zoe</span></div>

</div>

 <div class="question-container-5b">
      <div><span class="erin-5">Erin</span></div>
        <div>  Oh yes, many. The main one has been playing the guitar, but I also took up bread baking (like everyone else haha) and reading for pleasure more regularly!
